# BTC-Miner
a BTC mining program based on python3

Our project refers to the nightminer project by ricmoo, which is written in Python2 (https://github.com/ricmoo/nightminer). We refactored and implemented the basic mining function based on the sha256 algorithm and stratum-protocol using Python3.
We hope to share this program with those miners who want to understand and try the implementation process of mining algorithm. Since the hashrate of the CPU cannot compete with ASIC mining device, we recommend using some specific testing servers for project debugging and test(i.e. pool.bitcoincloud.net).

*English annotation are to be completed and released in the next version
